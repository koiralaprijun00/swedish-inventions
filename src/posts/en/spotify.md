In 2006, two Swedish entrepreneurs, Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzon, set out to solve a growing problem in the music industry: piracy. At the time, illegal downloads were rampant, and artists were struggling to monetize their work. Their solution? **Spotify**, a streaming service that would offer listeners unlimited access to music while ensuring artists got paid.

## The Early Days

Spotify launched in October 2008, initially targeting the European market. Unlike traditional music platforms, it offered a freemium model—users could listen for free with ads or upgrade to a premium, ad-free experience. This innovation made music accessible to millions while keeping it legal and sustainable.

## Global Impact

By 2011, Spotify had expanded to the United States, and its growth skyrocketed. Today, it boasts over 500 million active users worldwide. The platform’s use of algorithms to curate playlists, like "Discover Weekly," has redefined how we find and enjoy music.

## Why It’s a Swedish Success

Spotify embodies Swedish values of innovation and simplicity. From its sleek design to its focus on user experience, it’s no surprise this Stockholm-based company became a global leader in tech.
