# Listen Labs: Voice Interviews At Scale

Listen Labs automates qualitative research by letting AI conduct voice interviews with customers. Participants answer natural questions over the phone, the system follows up intelligently, and product teams receive polished summaries, highlights, and sentiment analysis within hours.

Founded in 2023 by Alfred Wahlforss and Florian Juengermann, the company operates from San Francisco with strong Swedish roots. Listen Labs has raised SEK 260M from investors such as Sequoia, Conviction, and Pear VC. Global brands use the platform to keep a constant pulse on customer experience without outsourcing large research panels.

When customer insight needs to move at startup speed, Listen Labs is the always-on research partner.
