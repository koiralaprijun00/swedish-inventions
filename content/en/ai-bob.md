# AI-Bob: Building-Site Compliance On Autopilot

AI-Bob tackles one of the construction industry’s constant headaches: ensuring every drawing and plan complies with Swedish building regulations. The service ingests blueprints, checks them against current codes, and highlights the sections that need attention before crews arrive on site.

Founder Elin Mårtensson built AI-Bob to help teams deliver safer, faster projects without drowning in paperwork. Municipalities and major contractors now use the platform to reduce rework, avoid fines, and keep audits smooth. As regulations evolve, AI-Bob updates its rule engine so builders always work from the latest requirements.

Compliance becomes a competitive advantage when every review is done instantly.
