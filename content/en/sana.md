# Sana: Enterprise AI Agents Trained on Your Knowledge

Sana launched in Stockholm in 2016 with a clear idea: every organisation should have an AI assistant that understands its documents, processes, and people. Founder Joel Hellermark has since built a platform that ingests company knowledge, applies guardrails, and serves a conversational agent employees can trust.

The team raised SEK 580M in 2024 at a SEK 5.3B valuation and also spearheads The Swedish AI Reform, offering access to training and tooling for students and the public sector. Sana’s agent handles onboarding, support, and workflow automation while keeping sensitive data inside the customer’s tenancy.

For many enterprises, Sana is the bridge between scattered knowledge bases and a truly helpful AI colleague.
