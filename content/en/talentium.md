# Talentium: Autonomous Sourcing For Recruiters

Talentium was designed for talent teams who need to map an entire market overnight. Recruiters describe the ideal profile and the AI scouts public data, summarises experience, and surfaces verified contact details. Shortlists arrive ready for outreach with context-rich briefs.

Founded in 2023, Talentium has grown with backing from EQT Ventures and other operators. It is part of a new wave of Swedish AI tooling that blends automation with human oversight—recruiters stay in control, but the heavy lift of research disappears.

Hiring pipelines move faster when candidate discovery is no longer manual.
