# Legora: Legal Workflows With AI Copilots

Legora’s founders Sigge Labor, Max Junestrand, and August Erséus set out to supercharge legal research. Their platform blends proprietary language models with attorneys’ playbooks so complex briefs, memos, and contract analyses can be drafted in minutes instead of hours.

Since launching in 2023, Legora has raised nearly SEK 800M from Iconiq, General Catalyst, Benchmark, Redpoint, and Y Combinator, landing at a SEK 6.5B valuation. The service connects firm knowledge bases, legislation, and precedent into a single AI workspace that stays inside the firm’s security perimeter.

By treating AI as a collaborative colleague rather than a replacement, Legora is defining what the modern law firm stack looks like.
