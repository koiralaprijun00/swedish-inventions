# Tandem Health: Clinical Notes Without The Keyboard

Tandem Health focuses on the conversations that define healthcare. Its AI assistant listens to doctor–patient meetings, captures the medical context, and drafts structured notes the moment a consultation ends. Physicians approve and file the summary instead of spending evenings on documentation.

Founded in 2023 by Oliver Åstrand, Oscar Boldt-Christmas, and Lukas Saari, the company has already reached SEK 180M in annual recurring revenue and attracted nearly SEK 500M in funding. Hospitals adopt Tandem to reduce burnout, tighten compliance, and deliver clearer follow-up instructions to patients.

The result is more time for care and less time wrestling with keyboards.
