# Lovable: Vibe Coding From Stockholm

Lovable rewires software creation by pairing large language models with a guided design system. Product teams and solo founders sketch their idea in plain language and Lovable turns it into a production-ready web application, complete with data models, UI scaffolding, and deployment pipelines.

The Stockholm-based crew launched in 2023 and quickly became one of Europe’s fastest-growing AI startups. By mid 2025 the company was reporting SEK 720M in annual recurring revenue and fielding term sheets that value the business at around SEK 17B. Behind the growth is a relentless focus on speed: projects that once took weeks now go live in an afternoon.

Lovable calls the approach “vibe coding” – humans describe intent, while the agent writes, tests, and learns from every release. It is a glimpse of the new workflow for builders everywhere.
