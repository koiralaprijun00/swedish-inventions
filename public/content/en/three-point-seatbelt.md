## The Problem With Early Seatbelts

Before the invention of the three-point seatbelt, cars were incredibly dangerous in crashes. In the early 1900s, vehicles had no restraints at all, and passengers were frequently ejected from their seats during collisions.

The first attempt at a safety belt was the two-point lap belt, which secured passengers only across the waist. While better than nothing, this design failed to protect the upper body, leading to serious internal injuries and head trauma in accidents.

Car manufacturers needed a better solution, and in the late 1950s, Volvo took on the challenge.

## Nils Bohlin’s Breakthrough: The Three-Point Seatbelt

Swedish engineer Nils Bohlin, who had previously worked in the aviation industry designing ejection seats, joined Volvo in 1958 with a mission: to develop a seatbelt that could fully protect passengers in a crash.

His solution? A three-point seatbelt, which secured both the upper and lower body with a single, Y-shaped strap. This design was:

✅ **More effective**: It prevented passengers from jerking forward or being ejected in a crash.  
✅ **More comfortable**: It distributed impact evenly across the chest, shoulders, and pelvis.  
✅ **Easy to use**: With a single buckle, passengers could strap in quickly without confusion.

Volvo introduced Bohlin’s seatbelt in 1959, making it standard equipment in its new cars.

## Volvo’s Historic Decision: Safety Over Profits

Unlike many companies that patent their inventions for profit, Volvo made a groundbreaking decision—they opened the patent and allowed every car manufacturer to use the three-point seatbelt for free.

Why? Because Volvo prioritized safety over money. They believed this invention was too important to keep exclusive, and by sharing it, they could save millions of lives worldwide.

Thanks to Volvo’s generosity, other car manufacturers quickly adopted the three-point seatbelt, and by the 1970s, it became a legal requirement in many countries.

## How the Three-Point Seatbelt Saves Lives

Studies show that seatbelts reduce the risk of death in car crashes by 50%. The three-point seatbelt absorbs crash forces and prevents passengers from hitting the dashboard, steering wheel, or windshield.

Here’s how it works in a crash:

1️⃣ **The lap belt** keeps the lower body in place, preventing ejection.  
2️⃣ **The shoulder belt** restrains the upper body, reducing head and chest injuries.  
3️⃣ **The design** spreads the force across strong bones (pelvis, chest, shoulders) instead of delicate internal organs.

The effectiveness of Bohlin’s invention is undeniable. By 2009, experts estimated that the three-point seatbelt had saved over 1 million lives—and today, that number is even higher.

## The Global Impact of Bohlin’s Invention

🚗 **Legal Requirement**: Almost every country has laws mandating seatbelt use.  
🚗 **Life-Saving Innovation**: The three-point seatbelt remains the single most effective car safety feature ever invented.  
🚗 **Ongoing Innovation**: Seatbelt technology has evolved with pretensioners and force limiters for added safety.

Even with airbags and advanced crash systems, the seatbelt is still the most important safety feature in any car.

## Swedish Innovation at Its Best

Sweden has a reputation for practical, life-changing innovations, and the three-point seatbelt is one of its greatest contributions to the world. Nils Bohlin’s simple yet effective invention has protected millions—and will continue to do so for generations.

So, the next time you buckle up, remember: you’re wearing a piece of Swedish history—a life-saving innovation that proves good design can truly change the world.
