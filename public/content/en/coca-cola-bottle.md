## The Birth of an Icon

Coca-Cola was first introduced in 1886, but for decades, it was sold in generic straight-sided bottles. Imitators began flooding the market, and the Coca-Cola Company needed a distinct design that could set it apart. In 1915, the company announced a contest for a new bottle design that would be unique and recognizable.

The winning design came from the Root Glass Company in Indiana, where Alexander Samuelson, a Swedish immigrant, was working as a glass designer. Samuelson and his team sought inspiration from the cocoa pod, mistakenly thinking cocoa was an ingredient in Coca-Cola. The result was a bottle with a distinctive curvy shape and embossed vertical ridges, making it easy to identify by touch alone.

## A Design That Stood the Test of Time

Introduced in 1916, the contoured Coca-Cola bottle quickly became a branding sensation. Its hourglass shape not only made it stand out on store shelves but also made it easy to grip. Even if shattered, its unique silhouette remained recognizable. This level of brand reinforcement was revolutionary for the time.

Over the years, the bottle underwent small modifications, but its essential shape remained the same. In 1950, it became the first commercial product to be featured in the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York, solidifying its place in design history.

## Swedish Craftsmanship on a Global Stage

While Samuelson may not have personally patented the design, his Swedish craftsmanship played a crucial role in shaping one of the world’s most famous products. His ability to merge functionality with aesthetics set a new standard in packaging design.

Sweden has a long history of industrial innovation, and the Coca-Cola bottle is yet another example of how Swedish influence has shaped global industries. From safety matches to Bluetooth technology, Sweden has given the world countless innovations, and the Coca-Cola bottle remains one of its most culturally significant contributions.

## A Timeless Legacy

Today, the Coca-Cola bottle remains largely unchanged, a testament to its timeless design. It has inspired fashion, pop art, and advertising campaigns, becoming a cultural icon in its own right. Even as the world shifts toward sustainable packaging, Coca-Cola continues to experiment with eco-friendly versions of its iconic bottle while maintaining the classic shape that Samuelson and his team pioneered.

In a world where brands constantly reinvent themselves, the Coca-Cola bottle proves that great design stands the test of time. Thanks to a Swedish-born innovator, one of the most successful branding stories in history was set in motion. Next time you hold a Coke bottle in your hand, you’re holding a piece of Swedish design history.
