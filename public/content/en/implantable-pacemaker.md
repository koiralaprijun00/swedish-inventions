In 1958, Swedish doctor Rune Elmqvist gave the world a heartbeat with the first implantable pacemaker. This tiny, battery-powered device regulates the heart, saving millions of lives. Teamed with surgeon Åke Senning, Elmqvist tested it on patient Arne Larsson, who lived until 2001—outlasting his doctors!

Early pacemakers were bulky, but Elmqvist’s design shrank them down, slipping under the skin to send electric pulses. It was a risky idea that paid off, turning a medical dream into reality. Today, over 600,000 pacemakers are implanted yearly, all tracing back to this Swedish breakthrough.

This invention’s legacy? It’s a lifeline, pure and simple. Sweden’s knack for innovation shines here, blending tech and compassion. Want to know more about pacemaker history? It’s a pulse-pounding story of courage and care.
