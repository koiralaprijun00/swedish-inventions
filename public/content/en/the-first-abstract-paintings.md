Picture this: it’s 1906, and a Swedish woman is quietly creating massive, vibrant paintings that defy every artistic norm of the time. Her name? Hilma af Klint. While Wassily Kandinsky often gets credit for inventing abstract art in 1911, af Klint was years ahead, crafting her groundbreaking works in secret. So, why don’t we all know her name? Let’s uncover her story.

Born in 1862 in Stockholm, af Klint was a trained artist with a flair for the unconventional. But it wasn’t just talent that drove her—it was mysticism. Deeply inspired by spiritualism and the occult, she joined a group called "The Five," where she and other women explored the unseen through séances. Her paintings, like the massive The Ten Largest series, weren’t just art; they were cosmic messages, blending bold shapes and colors with spiritual meaning.

What’s wild is that af Klint didn’t want fame. She believed her work was ahead of its time, instructing that it stay hidden until 20 years after her death in 1944. When it finally surfaced in the 1980s, the art world gasped—here was proof that abstract art began earlier, and with a woman no less! Today, her exhibitions, like the 2018 Guggenheim show, draw crowds, proving her timeless genius. Hilma af Klint didn’t just paint; she rewrote art history from a Stockholm studio.
