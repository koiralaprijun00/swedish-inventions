## Sweden’s Role in Developing the First Oral Cholera Vaccine

Historically, cholera outbreaks have killed millions of people, especially in developing countries. Although oral rehydration therapy and antibiotics help treat it, prevention is always the best strategy. However, early attempts at cholera vaccines were injectable, difficult to administer, and had limited effectiveness.

In the late 20th century, Swedish scientists at the University of Gothenburg and the Swedish biotech company SBL Vaccin AB led groundbreaking research on a new approach to cholera prevention. Instead of injections, they focused on developing an oral vaccine that could be easily administered and provide effective immunity.

After years of research, Dukoral became the first licensed oral cholera vaccine in the world. Unlike earlier injectable vaccines, Dukoral was designed to stimulate both intestinal and systemic immunity, offering better protection with fewer side effects.

The vaccine was approved in the early 1990s and has since become a global tool for cholera prevention, particularly in high-risk areas.

## How Dukoral Works

Dukoral is an oral vaccine that contains inactivated cholera bacteria and a non-toxic component of cholera toxin. It helps the body build immunity by stimulating an immune response in the intestines, where cholera bacteria typically attack. The vaccine is mixed with a buffer solution and taken in two doses over a short period.

Dukoral is highly effective in providing short-term immunity against cholera, making it especially useful for:

- People living in cholera-endemic areas
- Travelers visiting high-risk regions
- Emergency response teams working in disaster-affected zones

Although Dukoral does not provide lifelong immunity, it offers strong protection for up to two years, giving communities valuable time to improve sanitation and water safety.

## The Global Impact of Sweden’s Cholera Vaccine

Since its introduction, Dukoral has been used worldwide, particularly in countries facing cholera outbreaks due to natural disasters, war, or poor sanitation. Organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF have incorporated Dukoral into their global cholera prevention strategies.

This Swedish innovation has been instrumental in:

- Preventing major cholera outbreaks in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.
- Providing emergency vaccination campaigns during humanitarian crises.
- Protecting travelers and aid workers from infection.

## Sweden’s Legacy in Global Health Innovation

Sweden has a strong history of contributing to medical advancements and global health. Alongside the invention of Dukoral, Swedish scientists and researchers have developed life-saving treatments and vaccines that continue to improve healthcare worldwide.

## Conclusion: Sweden’s Contribution to Disease Prevention

Dukoral is not just a vaccine—it is a life-saving tool that has helped control one of the world’s deadliest infectious diseases. Thanks to Sweden’s dedication to medical research and innovation, millions of people have been protected from cholera outbreaks. The vaccine remains a key player in global health efforts, proving once again that Swedish science is making the world a healthier place.
