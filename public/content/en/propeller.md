Sailing got a major upgrade thanks to John Ericsson, a Swedish inventor who perfected the ship propeller in the 1830s. Before Ericsson, ships relied on paddles or sails—slow and unreliable. His propeller, a spinning blade underwater, pushed vessels faster and more efficiently. It’s the reason ships today zip across oceans.

Born in Sweden in 1803, Ericsson took his talents to America, where he built the USS Princeton, a propeller-driven warship. In 1844, it outraced a paddle steamer, sealing the propeller’s fate as a maritime must-have. He didn’t stop there—Ericsson also designed the iconic USS Monitor during the Civil War, proving his Swedish ingenuity on a global stage.

The propeller’s legacy? It revolutionized travel and trade, shrinking the world long before airplanes. This Swedish invention remains a cornerstone of modern shipping. Want to know more about Ericsson’s story? It’s a tale of adventure, war, and one brilliant idea that changed the seas forever.
